Sequences are 'ordered' collection of objects. Sets and dictionaries are not sequences, as
objects into it are not ordered. There is not first element, seconds element or last element.

Sequences use indexing to maintain the order. Index starts from 0, ends with (n - 1).
Sequences are itself objects, they are container type objects (remember almost everything is object in python)

Most common Python sequences are finite. However, there are some sequences that are infinite. However,
its outside of the scope of this repo.

Homogeneous sequence type: contains same types of objects. Example: [1,2,3,4,5]
Heterogenous sequence type: contains different types of objects. Example: [1, 2.0, 'hello']

Mutable: Allowed to change the state/data of an object
Immutable: Not allowed to change the state/data of an object

Basic sequence types in python:
1. List: mutable + heterogenous
2. Tuple: immutable + heterogenous
3. Strings: immutable + homogenous
