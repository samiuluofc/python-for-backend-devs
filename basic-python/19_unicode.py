Unicode: assigning a code to a character (code points: numerical value of a character).
It does not specify how to encode the code point in binary format.

UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format): Does the encode (binary format) for code point. There are others such as UTF-16, UTF-32 etc.
In python default is UTF-8.

So, Unicode and UTF is two different things.
